THE WVLOTTOPY DEVELOPERS HAVE NO AFFILIATION WITH THE WEST VIRGINIA STATE LOTTERY

This script generates the most likely lottery numbers based off frequency of winning numbers.

Previously there were records dating back to 1992 that were removed by the website, which has lead me to rewrite and encourage the collaboration and sharing of this work. I will attach an excel file in the near future that includes the previous records and soon try to reincorperate them into the script. Originally excel functionality was stripped for performance.

I am welcoming anyone who wants to to port it to their own state/country to do so. I currently have a website www.wvlotterypredictor.xyz hosting my numbers to be refreshed daily. Collaboration and suggestion to a more accurate algorithm is also welcome. I can be contacted about the project through my site email, on here, or on the Twitter linked on my site.

# Good luck!
