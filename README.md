THE WVLOTTOPY DEVELOPERS HAVE NO AFFILIATION WITH THE WEST VIRGINIA STATE LOTTERY

This script generates the most likely lottery numbers based off frequency of winning numbers.

Previously there were records dating back to 1992 that were removed by the website, which has lead me to rewrite and encourage the collaboration and sharing of this work. I have attached an excel file that includes the previous records. Originally excel functionality was stripped for performance but has been reimplemented.

I am welcoming anyone who wants to to port it to their own state/country to do so. I currently have a website www.wvlotterypredictor.xyz hosting my numbers to be refreshed daily. Collaboration and suggestion to a more accurate algorithm is also welcome. I can be contacted about the project through my site email, on here, or on the Twitter linked on my site.

# Good luck!

# CHANGELOG 
- June 29th 2022: Added support for old data that was previously scrubbed from the lottery site. It is more accurate and includes more data than the previous one. Chance for daily3 is now bugged however due to the large amount of numbers and dates. This will be fixed soon.

# TODO: 
- Correct chance numbers for Daily3
